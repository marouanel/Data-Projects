It leverages the web services of Amazon, eBay and Commission Junction to search for likely matches for UPCs and then aggregates the resulting data, displaying it in the form of a price comparison listing, lowest price first.

The engine runs as a Wordpress plugin for ease of deployment and employs multiple layers of caching (database and flat-file HTML) to maximize site speed. However, most page refreshes will require cached data to be refetched from one or more web service - maximum cache time is between one hour and 12 hours, due to restrictions on caching imposed by web service providers.

Still, the results are very consistent, only limited by the accuracy of UPC data provided by third parties - at an estimate, less than 1% of UPC searches have products with wrongly-allocated UPCs."

Once visited, you can see nice OVI map of place based on ISP of yours with clickable foursquare places to explore.
Plus current weather and forecast displayed.

If the location is urban you can have a lot of local online newspapers links under the map.

Just below are latest tweets from location (refresh works too) as well as located news feed from google.

Little magic thing happens when a place name (or address/city) entered instead of detected IP.
For example Sherlock Holmes Museum - to see what's up at Baker Street -> OK.

Know the place and want to refresh memories? Or wanna check views of where never was before?
Look, geo photos from flickr on the right...
Click for the picture full details or browse for next.

Previous tweets from specified location (as far as available) are reachable.
These tweets location radius is adjustable as well (to investigate the exact place or wider range).

One more cool feature is you can refine tweets within that radius for specific search words.
For instance, to locate tweets with photos from these geotagged scope just enter word (at bottom left) photo -> click search within!
Well, links on these photos (usually from fb, instagram, twitter, tumblr and others) are clickable... 
Hm... looking for ... what if to enter instagram cats -> search within?

What are (they tweeting about) recent news in newspapers ... ok, let's check nytimes -> search within!
More results? Just click Radius+ to increase search area...

Still using google search? Better use (twitter geo powered) search within!

BTW, how about vine.co twitter videos from the place? Sure, click THE VINES to watch it playlisted...

Under tweets feel free to check what's top on Amazon by random category (at the moment from 10 available global locations)!

Just under Random Pics spoiler are random space cats pics (for your pleasure)."	Geo Location Atlas	2013-10-01	['flickr', 'twitter', 'nokia-maps', 'foursquare', 'weather-underground-wunderground', 'quova', 'vine', 'paperboy']	['mapping', 'location', 'photos', 'search', 'tweets', 'weather']

Nationally, there were 124 million ED visits in 2011, of which the CDC estimates 50% could be handled in a primary care setting. With an average charge for each ED encounter approaching $700 vs. the average physician office charge of $150, every patient redirected away from the ED saves the payor $550. This represents a total potential market savings of $34 billion for facilitating correct use of primary care. 

Providing people with the tools they need to find appropriate care everywhere saves everyone, hospitals and patients, money and time.

Patients receive a SMS from triage.me post emergency room discharge. By sending a text to triage.me with their problem and current address, we route the person towards the nearest clinic, providing the address and a link to directions (for smartphone users).

Many clinics that work with the underinsured also often have variable hours and locations.

1098	"Who said that waiting at the airport should be an atomic bore? Nonsense. As long as you can use a service like WhileWairport, then waiting for your plane is going to be something productive. This service lets you get real-time information about flights and airlines directly on your mobile, and have that shared with all of your contacts on sites like Facebook and Twitter. Which means that if your plane is going to be late, then youâ€™ll be able to let everybody know about such a thing without having to make a single call, or even send a single SMS. A simple social update will do.

And the social scope of this service doesnâ€™t stop at that. No, WhileWairport lets you meet up with people who are in the same airport that you find yourself in. You can look for people who share your same hobbies and interests, and have a much more pleasant wait if your flightâ€™s been delayed.

And WhileWairport is useful for finding people to share taxis with, too. Simply make it clear where it is you are supposed to get to, and if thereâ€™s any matches then the application will instantly let you know as much.
